        A free, fully-remote hack day.<br/>
        
        <strong>28th of March 2020</strong> from <strong>9:30am</strong> GMT.
      </p>

      <h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>
      <p>Remote Hack helps developers and technologists get together to create solutions to Remote working, collaboration, and socialising. To go full-meta, we'll be hacking on tools for Remote hacking.</p>
      <p>As social distancing sets in and many of us switch to full-time Remote, this event is a chance to hack on things that make Remote a little easier.</p>

      <h2>What isn't it?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>A competition.</strong> There are no prizes, and no ceremonies. At the end of the day there will be the opportunity to show what you've been hacking on, if you'd like to.</li>
        <li><strong>A hackathon.</strong> We'll be taking breaks, and exercising self-care.</li>
        <li><strong>Aiming to fix the world.</strong> Things are pretty dire for a lot of people right now, and If you'd like to hack on something directly related to COVID-19 then 🙌, but you're equally welcome to build something fun, or just learn something new.</li>
        <li><strong>About delivering polished software</strong>. This is a chance to collaboratively explore an idea, see if something <em>could</em> work, or learn something new.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What will we be hacking on?</h2>
      <p>
        The theme of the day is "remote". Add your ideas as issues to our <a href="https://github.com/remotehack/remotehack.github.io/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a> for inspiration on the day. We'll come together in the morning and split out into small groups based on what interests us.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll meet in our Slack to say hi, and be ready to kick off on Zoom at 9:30am. We encourage you to take breaks, and we'll be pausing for lunch around 12:30 (we recommend burritos 🌯 to support your local Mexican takeaway). We'll come together again around 4:30pm to share our experiences and anything we've built.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the day we'll be on Zoom and Slack, and encourage you to drop in for a chat. We can also help you get set up in groups to collaborate remotely.
      </p>

      <h2>What do I need?</h2>
      <p>
        As long as you have a machine to hack on and an internet connection, you're good to go. We'll be collaborating on Slack and Zoom, and there are a bunch of really good tools for ad-hoc screen-sharing and collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've started putting together a list of <a href="https://github.com/remotehack/resources">remote hacking resources</a>.  Feel free to add anything you think might be useful!
