It’s been **THREE YEARS** since our first remote hack day.

Despite that, most of the day was spent trying to achieve a stable video call with the group.

We spent a good amount of time chatting about custom keyboards, finding duplicate files (and Rust alternatives to things), seeding databases, and the ethics in software. 

Ryan also learned that "server muting" someone while they fix their microphone is handy... but you have to remember to unmute them when it's fixed 😬.

Some hacking also took place, but we were so giddy with the birthday high that we didn't write any of it down.
