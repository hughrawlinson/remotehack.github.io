More RemoteChat than RemoteHack, which made it even more relaxed.

## Things people did

- **Adam** hacked his way into a MySQL container, and started exporting things to Prometheus, learning a lot along way. In a fit of productivity, he also cleaned his whole house and roasted a duck for Ducksgiving. Disappointingly this wasnt a celebration of the Mighty Ducks.

- **Hugh** showed us his new guitar.

- **Panda** tweaked his photo library layout, a masonry-like pure CSS & HTML setup with some clever eleventy/liquid templating to keep things random(ish).

- **Ruth** made some amazingly intricate paper flowers, though they were so good we're not convinced they weren't just _real_ flowers.

- **Ryan** moved from GSuite to iCloud mail, and discovered the smoothest piece of ops UX in the iCloud/Cloudflare DNS update flow. Very nice. He also told us his espresso machine is working, albeit in pieces on the kitchen worktop. With Panda and Adam, we named the machine Cosimo M15o, because all coffee machines should speak l337.

## There won't be a New Year's Eve Remote Hack

Many of us are likely to be far too weighed down by Christmas cake and chocolate to even contemplate a hack on New Year's Eve, so we'll be back to our regular schedule on the 28th of January. It feels a bit early, but merry Christmas, happy new year, and all that jazz.
