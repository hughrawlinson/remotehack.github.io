Quite a romp to ring in the new year, and the first hack of 2023 was a full deck of wild cards and wacky characters!

## Things people did

- **Dan** fixed his dementia clock and hacked on a birdbox camera

- **Ryan** dropped the news that Cossimo is dead, long live boring espresso machine, and then he also ordered a bunch of meal options using Ruby

- **Joe** saved a hedgehog

- **Pete** found zero XSS vulnerabilities in his company's React code, and also worked on a test framework to automatically detect buggy tests and dependencies precluding parallel test runs

- **Adam** declared that during the next hackday he would try to create and register a company in the UK

- **Hugh** dropped a bunch of sweet data API resources and then learned how Raspberry Pi Pico's PIO coprocessor works and made it blink some LEDs in order to figure out how to control a charlieplexed LED grid that ended up not working which is a matter for a future hack day

- **Piers and the Boys (catch them on tour in 2023!)** continued hacking away on all things camper van, developing an ESP32 microcontroller using MicroPython and Ultrasonic Distance Sensor for an oil tank level sensor, pushing levels over MQTT to a Raspberry Pi Mosquito server, and THEN worked on a Django app to log the telemetry!

- **Ben** got hungover while doing the washing up, and then recovered and received some Classic FM from a Software Defined Radio
