# How it works

## Beforehand

â†’ Drop by [our Slack group](/join) and say hi.

â†’ Browse some hack ideas on [GitHub](https://github.com/remotehack/remotehack.github.io/issues).

## 9.30am, Hello

The day starts with a Zoom call. Details of this are posted in the [#general Slack channel](/join) just before we kick off.

We'll have a very informal set of introductions, and discuss what people are interested in working on through the day.

## 10am â†’ 12.30pm

Your time to hack - work on whatever you want.

## 12.30pm, Lunch

Grab something to eat, join everyone on Zoom if you'd like.

## 1pm â†’ 4.30pm

More hack time - finish off things, or do something entirely different

## 4.30pm, Demos

We all get back on Zoom and chat about how our day went.

If you'd like to share; we'll have time to show demos of what we've worked on.
