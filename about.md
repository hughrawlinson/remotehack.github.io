## Why are we doing this?

Remote Hack helps developers and technologists get together to create solutions to Remote working, collaboration, and socialising. To go full-meta, we'll be hacking on tools for Remote hacking.

As social distancing sets in and many of us switch to full-time Remote, this event is a chance to hack on things that make Remote a little easier.

## What isn't it?

- **A competition.** There are no prizes, and no ceremonies. At the end of the day there will be the
  opportunity to show what you've been hacking on, if you'd like to.
- **A hackathon.** We'll be taking breaks, and exercising self-care.
- **Aiming to fix the world.** Things are pretty dire for a lot of people right now, and If you'd like
  to hack on something directly related to COVID-19 then ðŸ™Œ, but you're equally welcome to build something fun, or
  just learn something new.
- **About delivering polished software.** This is a chance to collaboratively explore an idea, see if
  something _could_ work, or learn something new.

## What will we be hacking on?

The theme of the day is "remote". Add your ideas as issues to our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/remotehack/remotehack.github.io/issues) for inspiration on the day. We'll come together in the morning and split out into small groups based on what interests us.

We'll meet in our Slack to say hi, and be ready to kick off on Zoom at 9:30am. We encourage you to take breaks, and we'll be pausing for lunch around 12:30 (we recommend burritos ðŸŒ¯ to support your local Mexican takeaway). We'll come together again around 4:30pm to share our experiences and anything we've built.

During the day we'll be on Zoom and Slack, and encourage you to drop in for a chat. We can also help you get set up in groups to collaborate remotely.

## What do I need?

As long as you have a machine to hack on and an internet connection, you're good to go. We'll be collaborating on Slack and Zoom, and there are a bunch of really good tools for ad-hoc screen-sharing and collaboration.

We've started putting together a list of [remote hacking resources](https://github.com/remotehack/resources). Feel free to add anything you think might be useful!

## Code of Conduct

All conferences and events should be friendly, safe and inclusive spaces for anyone to attend, and Remote Hack is no different. All organisers and attendees must abide by the [Berlin Code of Conduct](https://berlincodeofconduct.org).

## The Podcast

We'll be recording interviews with the participants throughout the day. Follow along if you like (the episodes are super short...around 2 minutes each).

NOTE: being interviewed is NOT necessary to participate in the hackday.

come follow along at [the RSS feed](https://remotehack.space/live/feed), or just search for "Airquotes the Podcast Airquotes" in your podcatcher.
